### 1. **Collision Detection and Physics Calculations**
   - **Current Implementation**: The existing `calcDistance` function in WASM is a good start, but you could expand this to include:
     - **Complex collision detection**: Raycasting, bounding volume intersection tests
     - **Physics simulations**: Vehicle dynamics, object interactions
     - **Pathfinding**: A* or other pathfinding algorithms for NPC movement

   - **Optimization Potential**: WASM can handle these computationally intensive tasks much faster than JavaScript, especially for complex scenes with many objects.

### 2. **Model Processing and Geometry Calculations**
   - **Current Implementation**: Model loading and processing happens in JavaScript
   - **Optimization Potential**:
     - **Mesh optimization**: Simplifying complex 3D models
     - **Geometry calculations**: Normals, tangents, UV mapping
     - **Model transformations**: Matrix operations for positioning and rotating objects

### 3. **Terrain Generation and Manipulation**
   - **Current Implementation**: Basic terrain handling in JavaScript
   - **Optimization Potential**:
     - **Procedural terrain generation**: Heightmap calculations, erosion simulations
     - **Terrain deformation**: Real-time terrain editing and sculpting
     - **Level-of-detail calculations**: For large terrains

### 4. **AI and Decision Making**
   - **Current Implementation**: Basic driver assignment in `app.py`
   - **Optimization Potential**:
     - **Path planning**: For vehicles and NPCs
     - **Behavior trees**: For NPC decision making
     - **Traffic simulation**: For realistic vehicle movement

### 5. **Data Serialization and Compression**
   - **Current Implementation**: JSON serialization in `app.py`
   - **Optimization Potential**:
     - **Binary serialization**: More efficient than JSON for large scenes
     - **Delta compression**: For network synchronization
     - **Scene diffing**: Calculating changes between scene states

### 6. **Image and Texture Processing**
   - **Current Implementation**: Basic texture handling
   - **Optimization Potential**:
     - **Texture compression**: Reducing texture sizes
     - **Image processing**: For dynamic textures or decals
     - **Normal map generation**: From height maps

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Expand the existing `calc.go`** to include more mathematical functions needed for these optimizations
2. **Create new WASM modules** for specific domains (physics, AI, etc.)
3. **Update the frontend JavaScript** to call these WASM functions instead of native implementations
4. **Benchmark performance** to identify the most impactful optimizations
